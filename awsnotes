Scale!

PinPoint: Analytics
Cognito: Users
Device Farm: Testing
 - Users with phones that don't run your app will leave a bad rating!
DynamoDB: NoSQL
S3: Storage
Lambda: Serverless
API Gateway: This is cool, you can set up an API for your resources (Lambda functions and DynamoDB etc) and it's
  protected and if your API is solid, you can sell the API, like WUnderground provides their API for a price,
  and they don't even own the data.
They also have things like text to speech, image recognition, and conversational bots.
CloudFront: CDN/caching for S3 buckets etc.
Looks like if you start with MobileHub, you can set up a lot of the services and download a demo app with
  everything baked in

PWAs
- offline
- homepage
- resilient
- responsive

App shell, bundled html/css/js, cached
Service worker: programmable network proxy, can't access DOM, so uses postMessage, has access to IndexedDB APIs
LocalStorage is blocking and sync, IndexedDB is indexed and async. Can access with JS, can be verbose LocalForage is Amazon's wrapper

Pushing for hosting on AWS, too. I'd be down, BlueHost is a fucking nightmare.
LightSail: more hands-on, flat rate ($5/mo), good for small projects
MobileHub: S3 + CloudFront + serverless, CLI
Fargate: enterprise web applications (has stuff)

PWA project, today we're WildRides
